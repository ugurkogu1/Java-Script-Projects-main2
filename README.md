# JavaScript Projects

Welcome to my repository of JavaScript projects! This repository will contain all the coding assignments and challenges I complete throughout my JavaScript course.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to store and manage my course projects. It serves as a central hub where my instructor can review my submissions and provide feedback.

## How It Works

I will regularly push my code to this repository for each assignment and challenge. These contributions will not only showcase my progress but also help in building an extensive portfolio, which is essential for my development as a proficient developer.

## Commitment

I am committed to maintaining all the code I write here, ensuring that nothing is deleted unless specifically instructed. This approach will allow me to reflect on my learning journey and improve upon past projects based on feedback.

## Note to Instructor

Please feel free to review any part of my code. Your feedback is invaluable and I am eager to learn and improve. Here's the link to my repository: [JavaScript Projects](https://github.com/your-github-username/JavaScript-Projects)

Thank you for your guidance and support!
